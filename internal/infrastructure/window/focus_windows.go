//go:build windows

// Giving the page the keyboard, which on Windows nothing else reliably does.
// Ported from ED Voyage Companion's internal/infrastructure/window.
//
// Wails hands the webview its keyboard from one place only: the main window's
// WM_SETFOCUS, which Windows raises solely on a change of focus. That handler is
// bound inside the asynchronous WebView2 controller callback, so whether the window's
// first focus arrives before or after there is a handler for it is a race. Losing it
// leaves the page with no keyboard at all and no way to ask for one: measured in the
// running application, document.hasFocus() was false and no key press reached the
// page, which reads as a dead keyboard rather than as focus sitting elsewhere.
//
// A mouse click fixes it because a click focuses the WebView2 child window directly.
// This does the same thing without the click, which is the only route that does not
// depend on the race.
//
// Package window is shared because the setup program needs it and the application
// may: they are separate Wails binaries and both can lose the same race. It imports
// nothing of the application or the domain; it names no product, because the window is
// found by enumerating this process's own, so either binary resolves its own.
